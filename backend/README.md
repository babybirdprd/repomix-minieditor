# Misaki Backend

This is the backend for the Misaki project. It provides API endpoints for orchestrating Repomix-powered code modifications, configuration management, and git integration.

## Features
- **Repomix Automation**: Generates code contexts and applies Repomix modifications automatically.
- **Config Management**: Ensures `repomix.config.json` exists and is up to date for each repo.
- **Flexible Config**: Accepts config overrides from the frontend, but uses robust defaults if none provided.
- **Git Integration**: Supports version control operations (commit, push, etc.).
- **API for Mini-IDE**: Serves the frontend and exposes endpoints for all major operations.

## Getting Started

1. `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The server runs at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or as configured)

## API Overview
- `/api/orchestrate` â€” Main endpoint for triggering Repomix orchestration. Accepts optional `repomixConfig`.
- Other endpoints: file operations, git actions, etc.

## Configuration
- See `src/repomixConfigUtils.ts` for config schema and defaults.
- Config file (`repomix.config.json`) is auto-managed per repo.

## Requirements
- Node.js >= 16
- Repomix CLI installed and available in PATH

## Notes
- Frontend must be running for full mini-IDE experience.
- For advanced config, see frontend and backend config files.
